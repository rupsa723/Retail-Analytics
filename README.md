## Introduction

This retail analytics report offers a comprehensive analysis of customer buying habits in the chip category, utilizing transaction and behavior data to reveal insights for strategic decision-making.

## Objectives

The primary objective is to deliver actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and drive business growth by understanding the factors influencing sales and customer behavior.

## Customer Segmentation Insights

- **Sales Drivers**: Sales in the chip market are primarily influenced by Budget-Older families, Mainstream-Young singles/couples, and Mainstream-Retirees.
- **Mainstream Segments**: Mainstream customer segments, especially Young singles/couples and Retirees, significantly contribute to higher sales volumes.
- **Sales Contribution**: The sales contribution from these segments is significant due to a higher number of customers and increased purchase quantities per customer.

## Purchase Behavior Analysis

- **Number of Customers by Segment**: Mainstream - young singles/couples and retirees show higher customer numbers contributing to increased sales.
- **Average Units per Customer**: Older families and young families generally buy more units of chips per customer.
- **Average Price per Unit**: Mainstream mid-age and young singles/couples are willing to pay more per packet of chips compared to their budget and premium counterparts.

## Brand Affinity

- **Spending Patterns**: Mainstream mid-age and young singles/couples are willing to pay more per packet of chips compared to their budget and premium counterparts.
- **Statistical Analysis**: An independent t-test showed that the unit price for mainstream young and mid-age singles/couples is significantly higher than for budget or premium young and mid-age singles/couples.
- **Brand Preferences**: Mainstream young singles and couples show specific brand affinities, e.g., they are 23% more likely to purchase Tyrrells chips and 56% less likely to purchase Burger Rings.

## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

- **High Value Segments**: Older Families and Young Families lead in total sales and quantities, suggesting they are the most valuable customer segments.
- **Minimal Differences**: There are minimal differences in purchasing behavior across Budget, Mainstream, and Premium statuses within Older and Young Families.

## Churn Analysis

- **Young Singles/Couples**: High churn rates indicate a need for targeted retention strategies.
- **Retirees**: High churn among Mainstream customers suggests potential for improved engagement strategies for senior customers.
- **New and Young Families**: Lower churn rates indicate effective retention or higher satisfaction levels.

## Seasonal Sales Analysis

- **Sales Fluctuation**: Monthly sales fluctuate, indicating variability in customer purchasing behavior throughout the year.
- **Peak Sales in December**: December shows a significant peak in sales, likely due to the holiday season.
- **Low Sales Periods in February and May**: These months experience the lowest sales, possibly due to post-holiday spending fatigue and pre-summer slowdowns.

## SWOT Analysis

- **Strengths**: High sales contribution from key segments; strong customer loyalty among older and young families.
- **Weaknesses**: High churn rates among young singles/couples and retirees.
- **Opportunities**: Targeted marketing to high-churn segments; capitalizing on seasonal trends to boost sales.
- **Threats**: Competition from healthier snack options; potential economic downturns affecting purchasing power.
